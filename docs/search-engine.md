# Search Engine Implementation

This document dives into why we use OpenSearch instead of relying solely on Django ORM for the admin backends and business search functionality.

## The N+1 Query Problem

The infamous **"N+1 query"** problem occurs when Django's ORM retrieves related data by making separate database queries for each object, instead of batching them into a single, efficient query. This significantly increases the number of database interactions, degrading the application's performance.

In our project, we encountered this issue in `core/views.py` while implementing search functionality that allows users to find businesses by their name, category, or location. An initial implementation that introduced the N+1 issue was as follows (resolved earlier in [commit 8898e6c](https://github.com/WilliamOdinson/Gastronome/commit/8898e6cccd0a506cc0e7f4655bdf02c79b87fc60)):

```python
cache_key = _make_cache_key(q, where, cat_label)
results_raw = cache.get(cache_key)

if results_raw is None:
    qs = Business.objects.all()

    if q:
        qs = qs.filter(Q(name__icontains=q) |
                       Q(categories__name__icontains=q))

    if where:
        toks = where.split()
        if len(toks) == 1:
            qs = qs.filter(Q(state__iexact=toks[0]) |
                           Q(city__icontains=toks[0]))
        else:
            qs = qs.filter(city__icontains=" ".join(toks[:-1]),
                           state__iexact=toks[-1])

    if cat_label and cat_label != "All":
        keywords = CATEGORY_KEYWORDS.get(cat_label, [cat_label.lower()])
        cat_q = Q()
        for kw in keywords:
            cat_q |= Q(categories__name__icontains=kw)
        qs = qs.filter(cat_q)
```

Specifically, the problematic part is the filtering by categories:

```python
if cat_label and cat_label != "All":
    keywords = CATEGORY_KEYWORDS.get(cat_label, [cat_label.lower()])
    cat_q = Q()
    for kw in keywords:
        cat_q |= Q(categories__name__icontains=kw)
    qs = qs.filter(cat_q)
```

This snippet triggers the N+1 problem because it implicitly causes:

- **1 initial query** to fetch matching businesses.
- **N additional queries** when iterating over these businesses if accessing related fields (such as `categories`) without proper prefetching or selecting related objects.

Without explicit optimization, Django fetches each businessâ€™s related categories individually, resulting in many unnecessary database hits. With many matching businesses, database load quickly escalates, significantly reducing performance.
